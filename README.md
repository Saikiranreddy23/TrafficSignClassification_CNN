# TrafficSignClassification
Classifying the German Traffic Sign using CNN.

# Overview
This project is a deep learning model for the classification of traffic signs. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in Keras and TensorFlow. The model classifies traffic signs into various categories, making it suitable for applications in autonomous vehicles and traffic management systems.

# Features

Utilizes the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset.
Implements a CNN with multiple convolutional and pooling layers.
Includes dropout layers for regularization to prevent overfitting.
Provides high accuracy in traffic sign classification.

# Requirements

Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualization)

# Results

Training Accuracy: 98.029%

Validation Accuracy: 92.57%
